APT - Advanced Package Tools:
This is a package that makes it easier and quicker to install
any software without the low-level required to installation.

SUDO - sudo is a command that lets me have root priveleges to do what I want
to do right now. Root privileges can be dangerous if I type a wrong command.
So, when running a normal command, I run it with my own user, which is different
from the root user. Appending sudo at the beginning will help me have more 
privileges.

Command Line = Bash = Shell:
cat index.html - shows the content of the file.
echo "Caio!" - shows on the command line this string
$ ls -a (-a is an option)
$ node -v (-v is a flag)
flag is related to a program.
user@ubuntu:~ $ echo "I'm writing to a text file!" > file1.txt (Writing to a file)

$PATH is important because it allows you to run programs from your command line without specifying the directory where the program is located. For example, you can run $ npm install dependencies without specifying where npm is located because your computer has Node and npm linked on the $PATH variable.
